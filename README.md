## 💡 About Me

I'm a builder and problem solver who enjoys taking ideas from concept to scalable deployment. My portfolio ranges from cloud-native AI applications, data-driven platforms, to security tools and rapid SaaS prototypes.

I'm driven by hands-on creation—whether it’s deploying AgroScan AI for plant health, building record management platforms for farmers, or leveraging ML in real-world apps.
