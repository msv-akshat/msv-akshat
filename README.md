### 💡 About Me

I’m a developer who enjoys solving real problems with fullstack code — from building frontend dashboards to crafting backend workflows, and automating data pipelines. My projects often involve databases, file uploads, role-based logic, and cloud hosting.

Currently building [Udhyan Setu](https://github.com/msv-akshat/UdhyanSetu_Final), a full-stack farmer data platform with Excel uploads, admin verification, and Supabase DB logic.
